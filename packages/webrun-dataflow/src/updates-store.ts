 *   (never yielded) by `readUpdates`. Records how far a cell has caught up to a
 *   signal's updates, independently per cell.
 *
 * The interface is storage-agnostic: it references no key encoding, separator,
 * or serialization, so it maps 1:1 onto a relational store (two tables;
 * `readUpdates` = indexed left-join; `removeUpdate` = `ON DELETE CASCADE`).
